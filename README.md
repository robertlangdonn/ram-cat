# RAM Cat

**Know before you load.**

A macOS menubar companion for Apple Silicon that reacts to RAM pressure in real time — built for people running LLMs locally.

## Why

Every time you run `mlx_lm.generate` on a 12B model you're playing RAM roulette. Will it fit? Will it swap? Will the system grind to a halt halfway through a response?

RAM Cat watches `memory_pressure` (the honest macOS metric — the same number Activity Monitor uses) and tells you exactly what's happening: a mood emoji that reacts to pressure, a loading spinner when RAM is actively filling, and a one-line answer to "can I load another model right now?"

Why not `psutil`? On macOS, `psutil.virtual_memory().available` counts reclaimable disk cache as used, so it *understates* free RAM — by 2× on a busy machine (psutil: 3.4 GB free; `memory_pressure`: 7 GB). Every number RAM Cat shows comes from `memory_pressure`, so the title bar, the free row, and the model-fit row always agree.

## Moods

| Title bar | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `RAM 😴 11.4G free` | Idle — nothing loaded |
| `RAM 😸 9.3G free` | Comfortable — model running fine |
| `RAM 😾 6.7G free` | Alert — getting tight |
| `RAM 🙀 3.5G free` | Frazzled — swap imminent |
| `RAM 😱 1.6G free` | PANIC — you're swapping |

The title shows **free** RAM in GB — the number you actually budget against ("does a 5 GB model fit in 6.7 free?"). The percentage and totals live in the dropdown. When RAM is actively filling (model loading), a braille spinner appears: `RAM 😾⣾ 6.7G free` → `RAM 😾⣽ 6.4G free`. When the mood changes, the title blinks three times so you catch it even if you're not watching.

The **4-bit fits row** is the main feature: given current free RAM, it shows which 4-bit quantised models will load and which won't. No mental arithmetic, no trial and error.

The **sparkline** shows the last 30 seconds of pressure history (10 × 3s polls). A flat line means stable; a climbing staircase means a model is loading.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robertlangdonn/ram-cat.git
cd ram-cat
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Requires macOS (Apple Silicon recommended). Uses the `memory_pressure` CLI which ships with macOS — no sudo, no extra dependencies.

## Model fit reference (4-bit)

Works on any Mac — the fits row adapts to your machine's total RAM. It lists every model size up to your installed RAM, plus the next two above it (so you know what an upgrade would buy you).

| Model size | RAM needed | Smallest Mac that runs it |
|-----------|------------|---------------------------|
| 1B        | ~0.8 GB    | any |
| 3B        | ~2 GB      | any |
| 7B        | ~4.5 GB    | 8 GB |
| 8B        | ~5 GB      | 8 GB (tight) |
| 13B       | ~8 GB      | 16 GB |
| 14B       | ~9 GB      | 16 GB |
| 27B       | ~16 GB     | 24 GB |
| 32B       | ~20 GB     | 32 GB |
| 70B       | ~40 GB     | 64 GB |
| 72B       | ~42 GB     | 64 GB |
| 90B       | ~52 GB     | 64 GB (tight) |
| 235B      | ~130 GB    | 192 GB |

Numbers are approximate (weights + a working KV cache at moderate context). RAM Cat uses live free memory to compute the ✓/✗ marks in real time — load a model and watch them flip.

## Detecting running models

RAM Cat scans processes for `mlx_lm.generate`, `mlx_lm.chat`, `mlx_lm.server`, `mlx_vlm`, and `ollama`. If it finds one it shows the model name (`--model` argument) in the dropdown.

## Roadmap

- [ ] `py2app` bundle so non-technical users can double-click
- [ ] Homebrew formula
- [ ] Alert when wired memory exceeds a threshold (model load complete signal)
- [ ] Ollama model name resolution
